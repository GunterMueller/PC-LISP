PC-LISP is meant to run on 32 & 64 bit Linux, Mac, & Windows.

Currently, the system has been tested on:

	64 bit Linux
	Mac (tested on Yosemite)
	Microsoft Windows

It should run fine on 32 bit Linux. 

To build on Linux or Mac:

	cd src
	make

On Windows do:

	cd src
	nmake -f Makefile.msc

You will end up with a file name "pc-lisp".  That is the system.

Upon execution of pc-lisp, it will attempt to load a file named
"pclisprc.l" in the current directory if it exists.  Any desired
initial state of the machine can be placed there.  You may want to
copy the file "pc-lisp.l" to "pclisprc.l" as a good starting point.

The manual is located in the file pc-lisp.doc

To exit the system use:  (exit)

You can compile a function as follows:

(defun fun (a b) (+ a b))

(setq cfun (assemble (car (ph-optimize (compile fun)))))

Now fun & cfun both add their arguments.
